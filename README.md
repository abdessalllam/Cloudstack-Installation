# CloudStack 4.20 Installation Guide

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is mainly for me but what the heck, feel free to use and edit. This installer will get you up and running with a  "sort of" LOL production-ready CloudStack deployment faster than you can say "virtual machine". But lets be honest if you use this cause your installation kept failing, probably you should hire a freelancer ;p.  
## For Manual Install
See the Instructions here: [Manual Installation Instractions](https://github.com/abdessalllam/Cloudstack-Installation/blob/main/Manual_Install.md)

## What This Thing Does

This script is basically your CloudStack installation buddy. It'll handle all the boring stuff like:
- Setting up KVM hypervisor
- Configuring MariaDB database (properly tuned, not just the defaults)
- Installing CloudStack management server
- Creating NFS storage for your VMs
- Setting up networking with bridges (because VMs need to talk to the world)
- Configuring all the security bits

## Before You Start
- You may or may not run `./safe_network_test.sh` before running the main Installer to check if your network is bridgeable (Not even sure if that a word. Hahhh). It's not required. So, Anyway, You do you.
  
### Hardware Requirements
Listen, don't try to run this on a potato. You'll need:
- **CPU**: Something with VT-x (Intel) or AMD-V (AMD) - basically any decent server CPU from the last decade
- **RAM**: 8GB minimum, but honestly 64GB+ is better if you want to run multiple actual VMs
- **Storage**: 
  - At least 50GB for the OS and CloudStack
  - A separate disk for secondary storage (this is where VM templates live) but not a requirement.
- **Network**: A proper network interface (not WiFi, please Hahhhh)

### Software Requirements
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or 24.04 LTS (fresh install recommended)
- Root access (you'll need `sudo`) for this script*
- Internet connection (the script downloads stuff), I got time to kill by writing this nonsense.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Download and Prepare

First, grab the installer:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdessalllam/Cloudstack-Installation
cd Cloudstack-Installation
chmod +x install.sh
```

### Step 2: Gather Your Information

Before running the script, have these ready:
- **FQDN**: Something like `cloudstack.yourdomain.com` (make sure DNS points to your server)
- **Database name**: Usually just `cloud` works fine
- **Database user**: Pick something like `cloudstack_user`
- **Passwords**: Strong ones! At least 8 characters, mix of letters/numbers/symbols
- **Secondary storage disk**: Like `/dev/sdb` - this will be wiped clean!

### Step 3: Run the Installer

Time for the magic:
```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

The script will ask you questions like:
```
Enter FQDN for this server (e.g. cs.example.com): cloudstack.mydomain.com
CloudStack DB name [cloud]: cloud
CloudStack DB user: cloudstack_user
CloudStack DB user password: [your strong password]
MySQL root password: [another strong password]
Block device for Secondary storage (e.g. /dev/sdb): /dev/sdb
```

### Step 4: Grab a Coffee â˜•

The installation takes about 10-15 minutes depending on your internet speed. The script will:
- Check if your system is compatible
- Configure networking (creates a bridge interface)
- Install all the packages
- Set up the database
- Configure storage
- Start all services

### Step 5: Reboot (Important!)

After the script finishes, **you must reboot**:
```bash
sudo reboot
```

This activates the IOMMU and cgroup settings needed for virtualization.

## Post-Installation
### **NEW** Now proceed to step 2 (Optional)
Required if you are using the same server for hosting VM's and/or Storage.
Step 2 Installer is from 8 Step in [Manual Installation Instractions](https://github.com/abdessalllam/Cloudstack-Installation/blob/main/Manual_Install.md).
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```
After this, You may verify if everything works with the next step and then you may skip the rest.

### Verify Everything Works

After reboot, check if virtualization is properly configured:
```bash
sudo virt-host-validate
```

You should see all "PASS" messages. If you see "FAIL" messages, something went wrong.

Check your services:
```bash
sudo systemctl status cloudstack-management
sudo systemctl status mysql
sudo systemctl status libvirtd
sudo systemctl status nfs-kernel-server
```

### Access the Web Interface

Open your browser and go to:
```
http://your-server-ip:8080/client/
```

Default login:
- **Username**: admin
- **Password**: password

**Change this password immediately!**

### Initial Setup Wizard

CloudStack will walk you through the initial setup:

1. **Change Admin Password**: First thing to do
2. **Configure Zone**: This is like your datacenter
3. **Set up Pod**: Think of this as a rack in your datacenter
4. **Create Cluster**: Group of hypervisor hosts
5. **Add Host**: Your server (the one you just installed)
6. **Configure Storage**: 
   - Primary: `/export/primary` (for VM disks)
   - Secondary: `/export/secondary` (for templates/ISOs)

### Adding Your First Host

When adding the host in the wizard:
- **Host Name**: Your server's FQDN
- **Username**: root
- **Authentication**: SSH Key (recommended) or Password

If using SSH key, the installer already set this up for you. The CloudStack public key is in `/var/lib/cloudstack/management/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` and has been added to root's authorized_keys.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Bridge not working"**: 
- Check if your network interface is up: `ip link show`
- Verify bridge has correct IP: `ip addr show br0`

**"Can't connect to database"**:
- Check MySQL is running: `systemctl status mysql`
- Verify database exists: `mysql -u root -p -e "SHOW DATABASES;"`

**"VMs won't start"**:
- Run `virt-host-validate` to check virtualization
- Make sure you rebooted after installation
- Check if IOMMU is enabled: `dmesg | grep -i iommu`

**"NFS issues"**:
- Check exports: `showmount -e localhost`
- Verify permissions: `ls -la /export/`

### Log Files

When things go wrong, check these logs:
- CloudStack: `/var/log/cloudstack/management/`
- MySQL: `/var/log/mysql/`
- System: `journalctl -u cloudstack-management`

## Network Configuration Details

The installer creates a bridge (`br0`) that:
- Takes over your main network interface
- Allows VMs to get IP addresses from your network
- Maintains connectivity to your server

Your network config will look something like:
```
Physical NIC â†’ Bridge (br0) â†’ VMs
```

## Storage Layout

After installation, you'll have:
- **Primary Storage**: `/export/primary` (NFS) - VM disks live here
- **Secondary Storage**: `/export/secondary` (NFS) - Templates and ISOs

Both are exported via NFS so CloudStack can manage them.

## Security Notes

The installer configures:
- UFW firewall with only necessary ports open
- MySQL with secure settings
- SSH keys for host managment
- NFS with proper access controls

But remember to:
- Change default passwords
- Keep your system updated
- Monitor access logs
- Consider additional security measures for production

## What's Next?

Now that CloudStack is running, you can:
1. Download some VM templates (CentOS, Ubuntu, etc.)
2. Create networks for your VMs
3. Set up service offerings (VM sizes)
4. Start creating virtual machines!

Check out the [CloudStack documentation](https://docs.cloudstack.org/) for more advanced configuration.

## Getting Help

If you run into issues:
- Check the CloudStack community forums
- Look at the official documentation
- Review the log files mentioned above
- Make sure you followed all the steps (especially the reboot!)

Remember, this is a complex system with many moving parts. Don't panic if something doesn't work immediately - troubleshooting is part of the fun! ðŸ˜„

## Final Tips

- **Backup your configuration**: Once everything is working, backup your database and config files
- **Monitor resources**: Keep an eye on CPU, memory, and disk usage
- **Plan your network**: Think about how VMs will communicate before creating a bunch of them
- **Start small**: Create a test VM first before going crazy with deployments

Good luck with your CloudStack jurney! ðŸš€
